Image Classification Model

Instructions

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Deliverable: A functional model with performance evaluation on a test dataset.

Notebook Description

The notebook Task3-checkpoint.ipynb contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification. It includes the following key steps:

Data loading and preprocessing

Model building using TensorFlow/Keras

Model training with appropriate loss function and optimizer

Evaluation of the model on a test dataset

Display of performance metrics such as accuracy and loss

Usage Instructions

Clone the GitHub repository.

Open the Task3-checkpoint.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells to train the model and evaluate its performance.

Modify the dataset path or parameters as needed for custom datasets.
